gollum-lib_rjgit_adapter
========================
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/gollum-rjgit_adapter.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/gollum-rjgit_adapter)

Adapter for Gollum to use [RJGit](https://github.com/repotag/rjgit) at the backend. This adapter is the default when your platform is JRuby, so you need only to `gem install gollum` and then use gollum normally.

Note: this adapter is new. Although it passes the full test suite for gollum (and gollum-lib), it might well still contain bugs. Please let us know if you encouter any!
